# Hello, I'm Jhonathan Sousa!

### ðŸ‘¨ About me :

Junior Front End Developer, with start in 2018 through a web development course, where I could take the first steps in technology.

To improve myself more in the world of technology, I took the technical course of systems development at Etec, where I was sure I would like to follow in this area as a front end developer.

Besides being passionate about technology , in my free time I like to play football (âš½ and watch) read books ðŸ“š and watch movies (ðŸ“ºand series)
